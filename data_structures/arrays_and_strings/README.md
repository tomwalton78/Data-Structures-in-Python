# Arrays and Strings

## Hash Table

Initial implementation based off of this [tutorial](https://www.interviewbreeze.com/learn/hash-table-implementation/).

## String Builder

Class to store strings as lists of strings, with append, extend and + (operator overloaded) methods, only converting to a single string when required (using to_string() method). Functionality inspired by Cracking the Coding Interview book.

## Array List

Class to represent a dynamically resizable array, with default resizing factor of 2. Functionality inspired by Cracking the Coding Interview book.

## Array Sorting

Contains sorting algorithms designed to work on Python's list data type.

Counting sort implementation based off of this [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort#The_algorithm).

Radix sort implementation based off of this [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort).

Remaining sorting algorithm implementations based off descriptions and code within Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition book, by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.

## Array Searching

Contains searching algorithms designed to work on Python's list data type.
